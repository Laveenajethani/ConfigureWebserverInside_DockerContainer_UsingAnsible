# Configure Webserver Inside Docker Container

**As we know that by default if we create container using centos image so inside docker container we can not do remote login using SSH but we can enable this feature**

**I have created dockerfile and from this dockerfile I will create my own customize docker image so that we can do SSH login inside the docker container**

In workspace I have created on folder Dockerfile and inside this folder I have Dockerfile .
